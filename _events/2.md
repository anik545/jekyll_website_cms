  "Is the Cambridge term making you feel lonely? Need someone to wake up to in the morning to share your thepla and chai with? Have you realised that scrolling endlessly in the comments section of Subtle Curry Traits for that special someone is a futile task? Perhaps you just want a companion to sit in a blanket with to cry to Kal Ho Naa Ho? WELL LOOK NO FURTHER because CUIS's own Shaadi.com is here"
