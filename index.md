Cambridge University India Society was founded by Indiaâ€™s first Prime Minister, the great Jawaharlal Nehru, during his time at Trinity College. It was set up to facilitate greater understanding of Indian culture within Cambridge, and serves as a dynamic social platform for both Indian and non-Indian students alike.</p>

We hope to raise awareness of cultural and political issues relating to India through our events such as academics talks, classes, film nights. We also host a variety of social events including club nights, formals, sports events, our annual garden party and of course, our legendary Annual Ball.</p>
<p style="margin-top:20px">
We are open to all students, regardless of race or religion - all you need is an interest in all things Indian! From fascinating guest speakers, to exciting social events, we have something for everyone.
